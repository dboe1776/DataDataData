## How to download python
Download the Anaconda distribution - Anaconda is a package manager that is tailored for engineers and data scientists. It makes things way easier. Download Anaconda here -> https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/

## Programming Environments
As an engineer, I recomend the following environments (first two come with Anaconda):

* __Spyder__
  * Provides a _MATLAB_ like interface with an editor, console, and variable explorer windows.
  * My go-to editor for almost any project.

* __Jupyter__ and __JupyterLab__
  * Provides a unique hybrid of coding and writing all in one place.
  * Supports rich text rendering (Markdown) alongside runnable code.
  * A fantastic option for documenting your project and tracking your thought flow over time.
  * I found Jupter very useful for taking in-class notes as it supports LaTeX equation syntax.
    * Plotting interactive Root Locus diagrams right alongside notes = total win

* __Atom__
  * A modern, clean, super flexible, open-source text editor
  * GitHub integration is fantastic
  * Download -> https://atom.io
